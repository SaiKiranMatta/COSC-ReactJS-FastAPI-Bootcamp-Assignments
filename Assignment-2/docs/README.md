# Assignment 2: React Utility Suite

## Objectives

-   **Enhance your understanding of JavaScript and React** through debugging and altering a project to ensure expected functionality.
-   Gain experience **managing routes** and extending component functionality.
-   Apply core React concepts, such as **state management** to create an interactive and user-friendly web application all while getting practical experience.
-   Strengthen your ability to **implement and improve component logic**, focusing on practical applications of **React hooks** and JavaScript functionalities.

## Overview

In this assignment, you will work on a React-based utility suite web application, focusing on component routing, state management using hooks, and adding expected functionality to existing boilerplate. Your task is to make the calculator functional, implement routing to the temperature converter, and then improve their functionality. You will set up navigation between different pages and manage state effectively using React hooks. This project will deepen your understanding of React, particularly in the areas of hooks and routing, which are essential for building dynamic and interactive webÂ applications.

<ul>
<li><h3>1. Test Your Application:</h3>

Ensure that each feature in your application is implemented correctly and functions as expected. Verify that the Roll Number displays in the Navbar, and that routing to the Temperature Conversion page works seamlessly. Test the Calculator to confirm that values are appended correctly, results are computed accurately, and updates occur automatically. Similarly, validate the Temperature Converter to ensure that unit selections, conversions, and automatic updates are handled correctly. Thoroughly test the entire application to confirm that all tasks are functioning smoothly.</li>

<li><h3>2. Submit Completed Code:</h3>

Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rls1-f5SSUDwPwgQlPy0maW_NrEFucpJ">this link</a> and upload your **src** folder and output screenshots to the folder named after your roll number.</li>
