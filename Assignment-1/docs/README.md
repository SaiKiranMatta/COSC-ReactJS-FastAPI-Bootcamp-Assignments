<ul>
<li>Copy the index.html file and make the changes mentioned below. Note that all modifications must be done using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and should be contained within the same file.</li>
<li><h3>1. Add Roll Number:</h3> Display a hardcoded Roll Number on the form.</li>
<li><h3>2. Add Additional Fields:</h3> Enhance the form by adding the following input fields:

-   **Email**: A field to collect the user's email address.
-   **Phone**: A field to collect the user's phone number.
-   **Address**: A multi-line text area to collect the user's address.

    Ensure that these fields are appropriately labeled and aligned with the existing design.

<li><h3>3. Change Input Label Styling: </h3>The labels for the input fields are currently displayed in black. Modify the styling so that all input labels are displayed in white color and are bolded.</li>
<li><h3>4. Display Form Values on Submission: </h3>On form submission, display all the values entered by the user (Name, Email, Phone, Address, Pincode) in the form of an alert box.
