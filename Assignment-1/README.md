# Assignment 1: Form Enhancement

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll be working on enhancing a basic form that collects user information. The form currently consists of fields for the user's name. Your task is to expand its functionality and improve its visual design. Below are the specific tasks you need to complete.

## Tasks

1. **Add Roll Number**: Display a hardcoded Roll Number on the form.

2. **Add Additional Fields**: Enhance the form by adding the following input fields:

    - **Email**: A field to collect the user's email address.
    - **Phone**: A field to collect the user's phone number.
    - **Address**: A multi-line text area to collect the user's address.
    - **Pincode**: A field to collect the user's pincode.

    Ensure that these fields are appropriately labeled and aligned with the existing design.

3. **Change Input Label Styling**: The labels for the input fields are currently displayed in black. Modify the styling so that all input labels are displayed in white color and are bolded.

4. **Display Form Values on Submission**: On form submission, display all the values entered by the user (Name, Email, Phone, Address, Pincode) in the form of an alert box. This will allow you to verify that all input fields are working correctly and that the data is being captured as expected.
